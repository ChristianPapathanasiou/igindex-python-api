IGIndex python API

C. Papathanasiou 2015

A framework class for the IG Index API. 

Based on:

https://github.com/lewisbarber/ig-markets-rest-api-python-library/blob/master/ig_service.py

I couldn't get that one to work as relies heavily on the pandas library which is a nightmare to compile on MacOSX.

Refactored code, created barebones version for what I wanted to do (obtain sentiment, open position, search markets). 

Can easily be extended based on official IG Index API spec available here:
